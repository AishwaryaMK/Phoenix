# Phoenix
This project aims for an interactive approach between the user and the chatbot. The datas are analysed by using Data analytic Algorithms in the background and the predicted results are communicated by the chatbot. This project is mainly proposed for the efficient use of water by predicting optimal crop to be grown considering the location, weather and previous crop history. The chatbot is trained using the knowledge base.
